# Mess-Feedback-Live-Counter
The Mess Feedback Live Counter System is a web-based application built using Python and the Flask framework to collect and display real-time feedback on meals served in a college mess. The system includes two roles: Admin and Student. The Admin creates daily meal list, while Students provide feedback by rating each meal as Good, Average, or Poor.
